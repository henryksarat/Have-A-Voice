                    Have a voice (“HAV”) firmly believes that government elected officials, by the people and for the people, should listen to their constituents while campaigning and in office. 
                    HAV provides a service that enables every United States citizen an outlet to let it be known what is being done in their community and provide a level of accountability for
                    those we elect. Government Officials can respond to the people’s concerns to let them know what they are doing to better the community. This puts the resident into the lime light so then they 
                    can decide if they should vote for that political candidate or vote for that politician come next election. Politicians are bound to what they say and have to work for the people.
                    No one should vote for a political candidate that does respond to their needs, we elected these officials and we have the right to <b>have a voice</b><sup>&trade;</sup>.  <br /><br /><br /><br />
