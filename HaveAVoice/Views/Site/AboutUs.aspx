                <div class="fnt-14">
                    Have A Voice sets out to solve a number of problems. The story behind the inspiration of Have a Voice is a 
                    perfect application of the website. Henryk Sarat, the CEO and Founder of Have a Voice, wanted to get his car 
                    windows tinted a darker shade. The previous year, Illinois passed a law that legalized tints to a certain darkness. 
                    Henryk tinted his windows and within a few months he received two window tint tickets for $250 each from the city 
                    of Chicago. Despite the Illinois law, Chicago executed “home rule” which allowed the city to ticket cars with 
                    tints. Interestingly, the fee for tickets increased 10 fold, from $25 to $250 when Illinois legalized tints. 
                    <br /><br />

                    Henryk didn't know which elected official to contact regarding this issue. He also didn’t know if his plea 
                    would even be heard. So he decided to create a central service where people can post issues within their 
                    neighborhood, city, state, or nation, and let elected officials reply to them directly and publicly. 
                    <br /><br />

                    This idea solved a number of problems:<br />
                    <img src="/Content/images/bubble.png" />Henryk didn’t know who his alderman was! With Have A Voice, he would just create an account with his 
                    information, and then his feed would display who his elected officials were.<br />
                    <img src="/Content/images/bubble.png" />Henryk didn't know who to vote for in 
                    the Chicago municipal elections. Henryk didn't want to go through dozens of websites to see what every 
                    candidate believed in and what issues they stood for. Logging into Have A Voice would display all of the 
                    issues that his elected officials and political candidates were behind instantly.<br />
                    <img src="/Content/images/bubble.png" />Elected officials are busy and don’t have a lot of time to discuss 
                    issues one-on-one with constituents. With Have A Voice, the official can see the issues his or her 
                    constituents are concerned about and can communicate with them via e-mail or message on the website. 
                    For example, Henryk’s alderman would log-in to Have a Voice and see Henryk’s issue about car tints, as 
                    well as replies from other members. He could then either contact Henryk directly about the issue or bring 
                    it up during his next council meeting.<br />
                    <img src="/Content/images/bubble.png" />Henryk can now find other people who share similar views. 
                    Since Have A Voice is geared towards people who are interested in politics and making a change, he can 
                    start or join a group fighting for something that he believes in. He can even create or sign a petition 
                    to change the tint law in Chicago. Once he would get a large number of signatures he can then present it 
                    to his alderman and show him or her how many people believe in the same thing. Before he would have to go 
                    door-to-door and get signatures and addresses. This is extremely time-consuming and not guaranteed for success. 
                    Although an online petition may not be legal or enforceable, it does show that voters are willing to put their 
                    name on something they believe in. It makes it much easier to get actual signatures when someone has already 
                    told you that they would sign the petition.<br />
                    <img src="/Content/images/bubble.png" />Before Have A Voice, when someone had an issue with a certain law or 
                    bill, they could discuss it with a friend or contact their elected official directly. The problem here is that 
                    it’s only one voice that is being heard. Have A Voice enables users to band together en masse and show their 
                    elected officials that they want to get something done. Issues, groups, and petitions can go viral by easily 
                    sharing them on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.  If you see an issue you believe in, a petition you want to 
                    sign, or a group you are passionate about, you can spread it among the three largest social media sites instantly.
