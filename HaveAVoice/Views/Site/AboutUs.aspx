					The mission of have a voice is to provide everyone with a way to voice their concerns to local and national politicians and political candidates easily and efficiently.
					Likewise, we want to provide politicians and political candidates with an easy and efficient way to respond to their constituents concerns about their neighborhood, city, state, and country.

				Have a voice believes that the officials should not only listen to their constituents while campaigning, but also while in office.
				Have a voice is a service that gives every person in the nation an outlet to let everyone know what is being done in their community or nation.
				Officials can then respond to their constituents concerns to let them know what they are doing to better the community.
				This puts the resident into the lime light so then they can decide if they should vote for that political candidate or vote for that politician come next election.
				Every response is logged so politicians have to be accountable for what they say.
				This means that politicians are bound to what they say and have to work for you.
				With that said, no one should vote for a political candidate that does not have a have a voice account and does not use it daily.
				You put these men and women in office and you have the right to have a voice.
