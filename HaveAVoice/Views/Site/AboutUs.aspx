					The mission of Have a Voice<sup>&trade;</sup> is to provide everyone with a way to voice their concerns to their elected officials and political candidates easily and efficiently.
					Likewise, we want to provide elected officials and political candidates with an easy and efficient way to respond to their constituents concerns about their neighborhood, city, state, and country.

                The idea of Have a Voice<sup>&trade;</sup> started when the CEO and Founder, Henryk Sarat, received two tickets for car 
                tints in Chicago. There was confusion as to whether tints were legal or illegal in Chicago. Tints were legalized 
                in Illinois and many of Henryk's friends and Chicago police officers he asked confirmed that he could have tints on his car. 
                After a few weeks of having tints, Henryk was hit with two tickets within a few weeks for $250 each. One interesting thing to 
                note is that once tints became legal in Illinois, Chicago raised the tint ticket fee 10 fold, from $25 to $250. Henryk tried to fight
                the case in court but Chicago executed "Home Rule" which can overrule the tint law issued by the state.<br /><br />

                Henryk wasn't sure who to contact, how to contact them, or if his query would even be taken seriously. He didn't even know who his
                alderman was! So what if a central system existed where people are given a voice in what goes on in their community and then their elected 
                officials can easily see what their constituents want done, in a transparent way? Have a Voice officially launched in February 2011. 
                Now users can participate in issues within their neighborhood, create and join groups, and start petitions to take action.
                Have a Voice was built with social media in mind and every issue, group, and petition can go viral by sharing them on 
                Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ with one click.<br /><br />
                
                Joe Sesso came on baord as Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer in July 2011 and on August 1st, 2011 the next iteration of Have a Voice launched with
                a new marketing plan. An ambitious 50/50 campaign was devised to interview and spread the word to all 50 alderman in 50 days in Chicago.
                <br /><br />
                ... to be continued.
