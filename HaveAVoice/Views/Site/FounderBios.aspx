                    While studying at the University of Chicago for his Master's in Computer Science, Henryk created a blog. Instead of using WordPress or Blogger he decided to create a system from scratch which includeded included social features such as friends and messaging.<br /><br />
                    After graduating the blog project was retired and Henryk started working at a Dutch high-frequency trading firm named IMC. While at IMC Henryk received a ticket that he thoght was unfair and he didn't know hwo to effectively fight it, so the idea of Have A Voice was born.<br /><br />
                    Henryk started working on Have a Voice part-time and finally launched it in February 2011. <br /><br />
