				Cookies are only used when a user logs in and specifies the <i>remember me</i> option.
				A cookie is then stored on the local computer that will identify the user once returned.
				The only information stored in the cookie is a unique personal identification number that is automatically generated by the system to identify the user 
                and an automatically generated hash code that will verify that the cookie is associated with that personal 
                identification number.
